![EASY LEARN Website Preview](/images/readme1.png "EASY LEARN Website Preview")

<p>In our day to day life, we have to deal with languages to communicate with each others to make our tasks done. When it comes to a language which is not our mother tongue, sometimes this communication becomes very difficult, if we are not confident enough of the language. On the other hand, though there are many resources to follow a specific language for a beginner, lack of free sources becomes an issue.<br>
When it comes to English language, it has become an essential factor to have the skills of reading, writing and communicating to cope with the present world. Therefore, it is very important to have a solid understanding of the basics and their applications of English language.<br>
As a team of followers of RSLUP, we are working on a solution to address the above mentioned matters and conditions.<br>
EASY LEARN English Learning Platform has been developed to make it easy for you to learn English language fluently, whether youâ€™re a beginner or advanced learner. Our aim is to show you how to apply English language appropriately in day-to-day life.
