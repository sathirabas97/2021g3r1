                <b>Active voice</b> means that a sentence has a subject that acts upon its verb. 
                <b>Passive voice</b> means that a subject is a recipient of a verb’s action. You may have learned 
                that the passive voice is weak and incorrect, 
                but it isn’t that simple. When used correctly and in moderation, the passive voice is fine.
                <br><br>
                In English grammar, verbs have five properties: voice, 
                mood, tense, person, and number; here, we are concerned with voice. 
                The two grammatical voices are <b>active and passive</b>.
                <br>
            </p>

            <br>
            <h1 style="font-size: 45px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-bottom: 50px;"><b>
                What’s the difference between active and passive voice?
            </b></h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>
                Active voice
            </b></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                When the subject of a sentence performs the verb’s action, 
                we say that the sentence is in the active voice. Sentences in 
                the active voice have a strong, direct, and clear tone.
                Here are some short and straightforward examples of active voice.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>
                Active voice examples
            </b></h1>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                <li>- Monkeys adore bananas.</li>
                <li>- The cashier counted the money.</li>
                <li>- The dog chased the squirrel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                All three sentences have a basic active voice construction: subject, verb, 
                and object. The subject monkey performs the action described by adore. 
                The subject the cashier performs the action described by counted. The subject 
                the dog performs the action described by chased. The subjects are doing, doing, 
                doing—they take action in their sentences. The active voice reminds us of the 
                popular Nike slogan, “Just Do It.”
                <br>

                Passive voice
            </b></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                A sentence is in the passive voice, on the other hand, when the subject is acted on by 
                the verb. The passive voice is always constructed with a conjugated form of to be plus the 
                verb’s past participle. Doing this usually generates a preposition as well. That sounds 
                much more complicated than it is—passive voice is actually quite easy to detect. For these
                 examples of passive voice, we will transform the three active sentences above to illustrate the difference.
                <br>
            </p>


            <h1 style="font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>
                Passive voice examples
            </b></h1>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                <li>- Bananas are adored by monkeys.</li>
                <li>- The money was counted by the cashier.</li>
                <li>- The squirrel was chased by the dog.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                Let’s take a closer look at the first pair of sentences, “Monkeys adore bananas” and
                 “Bananas are adored by monkeys.” The active sentence consists of monkeys (subject) + 
                 adore (verb) + bananas (object). The passive sentence consists of bananas (object) +
                  are adored (a form of to be plus the past participle adored) + by (preposition) + 
                  monkeys (subject). Making the sentence passive flipped the structure and necessitated 
                  the preposition by. In fact, all three of the transformed sentences above required the addition of by.
                <br>

            <h1 style="font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>
                When to use active and passive voice
            </b></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                Using the active voice conveys a strong, clear tone and the passive voice is subtler 
                and weaker. Here’s some good advice: don’t use the passive voice just because you think 
                it sounds a bit fancier than the active voice.
                <br><br>
                That said, there are times the passive voice is useful and called for. Take “The squirrel was 
                chased by the dog,” for example. That sentence construction would be helpful if the squirrel
                 were the focus of your writing and not the dog.
                 <br><br>
                 A good rule of thumb is to try to put the majority of your sentences in the active voice, 
                 unless you truly can’t write your sentence in any other way.
                <br>
            </p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 45px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-bottom: 50px;"><b>
                How to change a sentence in passive voice to active voice
            </b></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                Here is an example of a business communication that could be strengthened by abandoning the passive voice.
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                <li>- An error has occurred with your account, but every attempt was made to remedy it.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                That sentence is not incorrect, but it does sound a bit stiff and dishonest. 
                It sounds less trustworthy than it could—almost evasive. Who wants to do business with a 
                company that avoids taking full responsibility by slipping into formal passive voice territory? 
                Face the responsibility head on instead. Own it.
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                <li>-We made an error with your account, but we have made every attempt to remedy it.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                To make that sentence active rather than passive, I identified the subject: we. 
                It was “our company” that was responsible.
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                <li>-If there are any questions, I can be reached at the number below.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                The structure of this sentence is weak because it doesn’t identify the subjects 
                in either clause. Let’s unveil them. Who might have questions to ask? The person being 
                addressed: you. Who will be doing the reaching (by calling the number below)?
                It is still the communication’s recipient.
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                <li>-If you have any questions, call me at the number below.</li>
            </ul><br>
